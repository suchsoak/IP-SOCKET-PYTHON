## A scanner with socket and nmap, with information about a particular ip or url of a website.
## If you have problems with the code, or any comments about it, please let me know. For me to fix immediately. Any criticism I'm accepting. THANK YOU!

# WINDOWS:

Instalar python

https://www.python.org/

Then run in the terminal (CMD or PORWERSHELL), with python installed:

already with the requirements installed

And install the nmap:

https://nmap.org/download


The project took a long time to develop and I'm new to python, I intend to do other tools. In time I will update the IP-SOCKET-PYTHON


>Don't forget to download the requirements

### In the CMD or Powrshell terminal, you can start with: python3 IP.py

### And then the script runs.

Good Luck!

[*] As controversial as it is, the script is more for windows users. However, I intend to make an adaptation for linux.
